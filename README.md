## The SOLID Design Principles

<br>

### Single Responsibility Principle

The single responsibility principle is a computer programming principle that states 
that every module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part
of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

### Open-Closed Principle

> "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"

that means, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP, lsp) is a concept in Object Oriented Programming that states: Functions that 
use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

### Interface Segregation Principle
    
According to Robert Martin, The interface-segregation principle (ISP) states
that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 
... ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific
ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high level modules should not depend 
on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. 
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
